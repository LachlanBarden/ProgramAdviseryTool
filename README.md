# ProgramAdvisoryTool
<b>COMP3851B Major Project 'PAT' </b>
<br>Group members: Kimberley Hempsall, Lachlan Barden, Bohan He, Shenchong Chen

<br><b>Project aim:</b> to create a system that will advise UON students on which courses to enrol in next based on criteria such as completed courses, course pre-requisites and program requirements.
<br>The system will be created using a combination of SQL for the DB, C# and/or HTML for the interface design and possibly ASP.net to link the DB and interface.
<br>Main functionality at core will be accomplished using order of operations and T-SQL.
