Functions Kim and i have written to help break down the selction of courses faster. 

Might 'cheat' as in instead of having the functions read degrees and majors break them into seperate webpages that allows us to just write 5 seperate scripts that autocomplete the dropdown menus. However if we have time we will fix it properly
