I have been looking into what order (attribute called priorityLevel) courses should be completed in to most efficiently complete the IT degree w/ BTech major (e.g. all the courses that are \pre-requisites for another should be done first).

I am proceeding with the idea that all the electives & low-priority major courses will be completed last, or only as fill-ins when the core courses we recommend aren't available in the current semester that a student is enrolling in.


I came up with this draft order:

YEAR ONE
--------
  Semester 1:
    COMP1010
    INFT1004 or SENG1110
    SENG1050
    Major course #1 (for BT it would be STAT1060)
    
  Semester 2:
    INFT1150
    COMP1140
    SENG2130
    Major #2 (any from level 1000 or 2000)
 
YEAR TWO
---------
  Semester 1:
    INFT2031
    INFT2150
    SENG2260
    Major #3 (any from level 1000 or 2000)
  
  Semester 2:
    INFT3100
    Major #4 (EBUS3030)
    Major #5 (EBUS3050)
    Major #6 (any from level 2000 or 3000)

YEAR THREE
----------
  Semester 1:
    COMP3851A
    3 x electives or 2nd major courses
  
  Semester 2:
    COMP3851B
    3 x electives or 2nd major courses


I think it could also be useful to assign priority levels to the courses within majors too, so it can be used to sort the courses when they are provided by the UI as options? I will upload another copy of the excel data that includes the priority levels for this major.
